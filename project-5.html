            <h1>Project 5: An AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis API</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Integrating a serverless API with Amazon Comprehend to perform real-time natural language processing.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to build an intelligent API that could analyze the sentiment of any given text. This demonstrates the power of integrating AWS's pre-trained AI models into a serverless application, allowing for sophisticated analysis without building or training any models from scratch.
            </p>

            <h2>The Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                This project builds upon the serverless API pattern, swapping the database for a managed AI service. The entire architecture is event-driven and requires zero server management.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key components include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amazon API Gateway:</strong> Provides the public HTTPS endpoint that receives text data for analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Runs the Python code that receives the text from API Gateway and passes it to the AI service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amazon Comprehend:</strong> A managed Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that performs the actual sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Neutral) on the text.</li>
                    <li><strong>IAM Role:</strong> Provides the Lambda function with the secure, least-privilege permissions needed to call the Amazon Comprehend service.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>The Test: Analyzing Text in Real Time</h2>
            <p>
                After deploying the API, I tested it using the `curl` command-line tool. I sent various text samples (positive, negative, and neutral) in a `POST` request and successfully received a JSON response containing the correct sentiment and confidence scores, proving the end-to-end integration was working perfectly.
