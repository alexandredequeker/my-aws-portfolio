            <h1>Project 4: A Serverless REST API</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Building a highly scalable, cost-effective backend using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goal was to build a modern backend for a web or mobile application that requires no server management. The solution needed to be able to handle unpredictable traffic spikes, scale automatically, and be extremely cost-effective by only paying for requests as they occur.
            </p>

            <h2>The Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                I built a classic and powerful serverless pattern. The entire architecture is event-driven and fully managed by AWS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key components include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amazon API Gateway:</strong> Provides a secure and scalable public "front door" (an HTTP endpoint) for the application.</li>
                    <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Acts as the serverless compute layer, running the backend logic in Node.js to process incoming requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB:</strong> A fully managed NoSQL database that provides low-latency data storage and retrieval, scaling seamlessly with the workload.</li>
                    <li><strong>IAM Role:</strong> Provides the Lambda function with the secure permissions needed to access the DynamoDB table.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>The Test: Verifying Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                After deploying the API, I tested it using the `curl` command-line tool. I successfully sent a `POST` request to create a new item in the DynamoDB table and then used a `GET` request with the new item's ID to retrieve it, confirming the entire end-to-end workflow was fully functional.
