            <h1>Project 2: Highly Available & Scalable Web Application</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A classic three-tier architecture deployed with AWS Elastic Beanstalk to ensure resilience and automatic scaling.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goal was to deploy a web application that could automatically scale to handle traffic spikes and self-heal from an instance failure. This required an architecture with no single point of failure, mirroring a real-world production environment.
            </p>

            <h2>The Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                I used AWS Elastic Beanstalk to orchestrate the creation of a classic, fault-tolerant web environment. The diagram below shows the final architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key components include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB):</strong> Distributes incoming traffic across multiple Availability Zones to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Auto Scaling Group (ASG):</strong> Manages the EC2 instances, automatically adding more instances during traffic spikes (scaling out) and replacing any instances that fail health checks (self-healing).</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-AZ EC2 Instances:</strong> The application runs on instances in at least two different Availability Zones, ensuring the application can survive a data center outage.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>The Test: Simulating a Failure</h2>
            <p>
                After the environment was deployed, I performed a resilience test by manually terminating the active EC2 instance. The Auto Scaling Group immediately detected the failure, and within minutes, automatically provisioned a new, healthy instance to take its place, proving the self-healing capability of the architecture.
